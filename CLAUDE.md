Most of the times it's not necessary to build the site, because the local development uses `npm run site:dev` script which rebuilds the site on every change.

It's best to look in site/ folder rather than the docs/ folder to understand how the website is build, since the former contains the source code to build the files in the latter.

When I ask for visual changes, consider both desktop and mobile sizes/versions.
